# README 


This repository contains the public H5N1 cattle sequences deposited into the SRA by the USDA NVSL team. These raw reads were assembled and mapped by a team of people, and desposited in [this github repo](https://github.com/andersen-lab/avian-influenza/tree/master). I took these sequences, assigned clades with LABEL, and put them in Nextstrain format. Please feel free to use this however you wish.
